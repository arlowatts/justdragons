SimpleDungeon is a minimal role-playing game framework - that means no fluff and no spell lists! Designed for adventurers who want to play loose with the rules, it's a lightweight system with unlimited possibilities. With a good game master and great friends, SimpleDungeon can provide a smooth and natural role-playing experience.

## Overview

When you're playing a game within the SimpleDungeon framework, it's important to remember why. Do you just want to have fun with your friends? Or do you want to explore moral dilemmas through a new lens? Since SimpleDungeon is so universal, it's up to you to make sure you don't lose sight of your goals.

Like many other role-playing game frameworks, SimpleDungeon games are played at a tabletop with three or more players. One of the players is the game master, and the rest are player characters. The **game master** is responsible for introducing the setting and telling the other players what happens in the game world as the game progresses. The **player characters** each role-play their own personal avatar and narrate their actions in the game world.

## Creating a Character

Creating a character, whether it's a player character's avatar or a game master's villain, is as easy as anything else in SimpleDungeon. The first and most important step is to define the character's motives, personality, and background. These decisions will inform the rest of the character as well as how you role-play them in a game. Here are some helpful questions you can ask yourself when creating a character:

- What does your character want? Are they seeking fame and fortune? Or to fulfill a promise to a lost loved one?
- How does your character live? What do they do every day?
- Who did your character used to be? What's their background, and how did that shape who they are now?
- Is your character athletic and agile? Intellectual and inventive? How have their physical capabilities influenced their personality?
- What material possessions does your character have? Is your character wealthy? Do they carry trinkets of sentimental value?
- Does your character have any friends or relations? Does your character still speak with them? How have they influenced your character's ideals?
- Is your character part of an organization or society? Does your character agree with their purpose?
- Who has your character influenced and inspired? Have they performed epic deeds? Or mentored someone in their care?

Strong answers to these questions will keep your character grounded throughout the game and will make it easier for you to improvise. When you find yourself at a loss for words, come back to these questions to find your footing.

> Not feeling it with these prompts? There are many ways to create a character, and you can do it however you like. What's important in the end is that you feel comfortable role-playing your character and that you understand them well enough to improvise.

## Mechanics of a Character

Now that you've developed the personality and background of your character, it's time to give them some numbers.

### Statistics

A character's physical and mental attributes are quantified as statistics. A **statistic** is a number that represents a character's capability in a certain area. In SimpleDungeon, each character has six statistics:

- **Strength** represents your character's physical strength. It helps you hit things, carry things, throw things, and lift things.
- **Dexterity** is your character's agility. A high dexterity score will help your character walk quietly, dodge attacks, and walk on narrow ledges without falling.
- **Constitution** represents how tough your character is. High constitution allows your character to take more hits before dying, hold their breath for longer, and run farther before getting tired.
- **Creativity** represents your character's ability to invent. A high creativity score will help your character reach conclusions more quickly, cast spells, and come up with ideas.
- **Sensitivity** covers intuition, insight, and your ability to see and hear. Sensitivity is needed to notice subtle clues, such as a slip of the tongue or a marking on a wall.
- **Charisma** represents your character's talent for social interaction. With a high charisma score you can more easily persuade, intimidate, deceive, and perform.

Each statistic is assigned a value between 1 and 6. To choose the value for each statistic, simply rank them! Your best statistic is 6, your second best is 5, and so on to your worst which is 1. A higher number is always better, so choose your ordering carefully!

### Skills

Each character has five skills. A **skill** is a special ability of a character not described by their statistics. It's usually described as a single action, such as "climbing trees" or "drawing maps". During the game, you can use your character's skills to gain a bonus when doing things they apply to. For example, a character skilled in "imitating voices" might be able to mimic bird calls too. If possible, draw your character's skills from their backstory. Get creative!

### Hit Points

Depending on how your game goes, your character (or their enemies) may get hurt. A character's vitality is measured by the number of **hit points** they have remaining, ranging between 0 and their constitution score. An effect that heals a character cannot increase their hit points past their constitution score, and an effect that harms them cannot drop their hit points below 0. If you find yourself with only a few hit points remaining, you should be careful - if you lose them all, you'll die!
