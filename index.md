SimpleDungeon is a minimal role-playing game framework - that means no fluff and no spell lists! Designed for adventurers who want to play loose with the rules, it's a lightweight system with unlimited possibilities. With a few friends and a good game master, SimpleDungeon can provide a smooth and natural role-playing experience.

## Overview

Like many other role-playing game frameworks, SimpleDungeon is best played at a tabletop with three or more players. One of the players is the **game master**, and the rest are **player characters**. The game master is responsible for introducing the setting and telling the other players what happens in the game world as the game progresses. The player characters each role-play a personal avatar and narrate their actions in the game world.

## Creating a Character

The first and most important step to creating a character is defining their personality, motives, and background. These decisions will inform the rest of the character as well as how you role-play them in a game. Here are some helpful questions you can ask yourself when creating a character:

- What does your character want? Are they seeking fame and fortune? Or are they trying fulfill a promise to a lost loved one?
- How does your character live? What do they do every day?
- Who did your character used to be? What's their background, and how did that shape who they are now?
- Is your character athletic and agile? Intellectual and inventive? How have their physical capabilities influenced their personality?
- What material possessions does your character have? Is your character wealthy? Do they carry heirlooms of sentimental value? Or artifacts of cultural significance?
- Does your character have any friends or relations? How does your character interact with them? How have they influenced your character's ideals?
- Is your character part of an organization or society? Does your character agree with their purpose and practices?
- Who has your character influenced and inspired? Have they performed epic deeds? Or mentored a student?
- What is your character's culture? Do they live in a close community? Or are their neighbors strangers?

Strong answers to these questions will keep your character grounded throughout the game and will make it easier for you to improvise. When you find yourself at a loss for words, come back to these questions to find your footing.

> Not feeling it with these prompts? There are many ways to create a character, and you can do it however you like. What's important in the end is that you feel comfortable role-playing your character and that you understand their personality well enough to improvise in unexpected situations.

## Mechanics of a Character

Now that you've developed the personality and background of your character, it's time to give them some numbers.

### Statistics

A character's physical attributes are quantified as **statistics**. A statistic is a number that represents a character's capability in a certain area. Each character has three statistics:

- **Strength** is your character's physical strength. It helps you hit things, carry things, throw things, and lift things.
- **Agility** represents your character's control over their body. A high agility score will help your character walk quietly, scale walls, and dodge falling debris.
- **Stamina** tells you how tough your character is. High stamina allows your character to hold their breath for longer, run farther before getting tired, and more easily withstand a heavy blow.

To set your character's statistics, assign each one a number between 1 and 6 so that they all add up to 8. A well-rounded adventurer might have 3 strength, 2 dexterity, and 3 stamina. A min-max thief, on the other hand, could have 1 strength, 6 agility, and 1 stamina. A higher number is always better, so assign your statistics wisely!

### Skills

Each character has five **skills**. A skill is any special ability of a character that isn't described by their statistics. Your skills can be anything, but they're usually described as a single action, such as "climbing trees" or "drawing maps". During the game, you can use one of your character's skills when you're doing something it applies to. For example, a character skilled in "imitating voices" might be able to mimic bird calls too. If possible, draw your character's skills from their backstory. Get creative!

### Hit Points

Depending on how your game goes, your character might sometimes get hurt. If your character gets hurt a lot, they could die. To measure how close you are to death, your character has a number of **hit points** ranging from 0 to their stamina statistic. You start with a number of hit points equal to your stamina, and you lose hit points each time you get hurt. If you ever reach 0 hit points, you die. You'll usually only lose one hit point at a time, but certain effects could subtract two or more in one go. Be careful out there!

## Playing the Game

You have your character in front of you and your friends at your side. It's time to get into it!

### Ability and Contest Checks

During a game, your character might face challenges that can't be resolved through role-play alone. How will you know if your character is strong enough to break down a door? Or agile enough to run on rooftops without falling? In these situations you'll make either an **ability check** or a **contest check** with the relevant statistic to see if you succeed.

To make an ability check, the game master first sets a threshold. They may or may not tell you what it is. Then, you roll an 8-sided die and add your relevant statistic. If the result is equal to or higher than the threshold, you succeed! Otherwise, you fail the check and must face the consequences.

You can also apply your skills to an ability check. If one of your skills is relevant to the check, you can roll the die twice and choose which roll you want to use. If more than one of your skills is relevant, you can still only roll the die twice. Sorry, no overlapping skills!

A contest check, on the other hand, is very similar to an ability check. The only difference is that instead of making the check against a predetermined threshold, your result is compared to another character's roll. The two characters may make use different statistics in the contest. The character with the higher result wins the contest and the other loses it. In the case of a tie, the winner should be chosen randomly (such as by flipping a coin).

### Initiative

Often during a role-playing game, multiple characters will all want to do different things at the same time. If you can't agree on who should go first, then choose a random order. This can be done by having each character roll a die and then letting the characters with higher results act before the characters with lower results. If a group of characters all want to act together, then you can save time by rolling only die for the whole group.

For example, say a group of player characters walk around a corner and find themselves face to face with their arch-nemesis. They'll probably want to do something right away, and their nemesis will probably want to do something too! Since there's no way either will let the other act first, roll one die for all of the characters together and one die for their nemesis to determine who goes first.

In many situations, like in the example above, characters will interact with each other during initiative. To keep things fair, characters should take turns doing things. After a character's turn ends, the next character gets to take a turn. Each character should be limited to one discrete action during their turn to approximate real-time action as closely as possible.

### Combat

Fighting is never encouraged, but sometimes it happens anyway. Fortunately, we already know how to do it! Initiative is designed exactly for this type of encounter and should allow you to fight almost anything. Contest checks can be used when one character wants to attack another, and an attack can remove a hit point from the victim if it's successful. Different situations call for different types of contest checks, so keep your wits about you and try to avoid falling into a routine.

### Magic

Sword and sorcery fantasy is a popular genre for role-playing games. So where's the sorcery? Depending on the setting, there may or may not be some magic items lying around that you can use to create magical effects. There's no limit to what a magical effect can do, so you'll just have to trust that your game master will keep things fair. Be aware, however, that you may not be able to find out everything a magic item does just by looking at it!
