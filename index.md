SimpleDungeon is a minimal role-playing game framework - that means no fluff and no spell lists! SimpleDungeon is designed for adventurers who want to explore a world unconstrained by rules. With a good Game Master and great friends, SimpleDungeon can provide a smooth and natural role-playing experience.

## Overview

When you're playing a game within the SimpleDungeon framework, it's important to remember why. Do you just want to have fun with your friends? Or do you want to explore moral dilemmas through a new lens? Since SimpleDungeon is so universal, it's up to you to make sure you don't lose sight of your goals.

Like many other role-playing game frameworks, SimpleDungeon games are played at a tabletop with three or more players. One of the players is the *Game Master*, and the rest are *player characters*. The Game Master is responsible for introducing the session and telling the other players what happens in the game world as the game progresses. The player characters, on the other hand, each role-play their own personal avatar and narrate their actions in the game world.
