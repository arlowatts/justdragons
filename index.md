SimpleDungeon is a minimal role-playing game framework - that means no fluff and no spell lists! Designed for adventurers who want to play loose with the rules, it's a lightweight system with unlimited possibilities. With a good game master and great friends, SimpleDungeon can provide a smooth and natural role-playing experience.

## Overview

When you're playing a game within the SimpleDungeon framework, it's important to remember why. Do you just want to have fun with your friends? Or do you want to explore moral dilemmas through a new lens? Since SimpleDungeon is so universal, it's up to you to make sure you don't lose sight of your goals.

Like many other role-playing game frameworks, SimpleDungeon games are played at a tabletop with three or more players. One of the players is the **game master**, and the rest are **player characters**. The **game master** is responsible for introducing the setting and telling the other players what happens in the game world as the game progresses. The **player characters** each role-play their own personal avatar and narrate their actions in the game world.

## Creating a Character

Creating a character, whether it's a player character's avatar or a game master's villain, is as easy as anything else. The first and most important step is to define the character's motives, personality, and background. These decisions will inform the rest of the character as well as how you role-play them in a game. Here are some helpful questions you can ask yourself when creating a character:

- What does your character want? Are they seeking fame and fortune? Or to fulfill a promise to a lost loved one?
- How does your character live? What do they do every day?
- Who did your character used to be? What's their background, and how did that shape who they are now?
- Is your character athletic and agile? Intellectual and inventive? How have their physical capabilities influenced their personality?
- What material possessions does your character have? Is your character wealthy? Do they carry trinkets of sentimental value?
- Does your character have any friends or relations? Does your character still speak with them? How have they influenced your character's ideals?
- Is your character part of an organization or society? Does your character agree with their purpose?
- Who has your character influenced and inspired? Have they performed epic deeds? Or mentored someone in their care?

Strong answers to these questions will keep your character grounded throughout the game and will make it easier for you to improvise. When you find yourself at a loss for words, come back to these questions to find your footing.

> Not feeling it with these prompts? There are many ways to create a character, and you can do it however you like. What's important in the end is that you feel comfortable role-playing your character and that you understand them well enough to improvise.

## Mechanics of a Character

Now that you've developed the personality and background of your character, it's time to give them some numbers.

### Statistics

A character's physical and mental attributes are quantified as **statistics**. A **statistic** is a number that represents a character's capability in a certain area. Each character has six statistics:

- **Strength** represents your character's physical strength. It helps you hit things, carry things, throw things, and lift things.
- **Dexterity** is your character's agility. A high dexterity score will help your character walk quietly, dodge attacks, and walk on narrow ledges without falling.
- **Constitution** represents how tough your character is. High constitution allows your character to take more hits before dying, hold their breath for longer, and run farther before getting tired.
- **Creativity** represents your character's ability to invent. A high creativity score will help your character reach conclusions more quickly, cast spells, and come up with ideas.
- **Sensitivity** covers intuition, insight, and your ability to see and hear. Sensitivity is needed to notice subtle clues, such as a slip of the tongue or a marking on a wall.
- **Charisma** represents your character's talent for social interaction. With a high charisma score you can more easily persuade, intimidate, deceive, and perform.

Each statistic is assigned a value between 1 and 6. To choose the value for each statistic, simply rank them! Your best statistic is 6, your second best is 5, and so on to your worst which is 1. A higher number is always better, so choose your ordering carefully!

### Skills

Each character has five **skills**. A **skill** is a special ability of a character not described by their statistics. It's usually described as a single action, such as "climbing trees" or "drawing maps". During the game, you can use your character's skills to gain a bonus when doing things they apply to. For example, a character skilled in "imitating voices" might be able to mimic bird calls too. If possible, draw your character's skills from their backstory. Get creative!

### Hit Points

Depending on how your game goes, your character (or their enemies) may get hurt. A character's vitality is measured by the number of **hit points** they have remaining, ranging between 0 and their constitution score. An effect that heals a character cannot increase their hit points past their constitution score, and an effect that harms them cannot drop their hit points below 0. If you find yourself with only a few hit points remaining, you should be careful - if you lose them all, you'll die!

### Spell Points

Sword and sorcery fantasy is a popular genre for role-playing games. So where's the sorcery? (For the sword, see [Combat](#combat) below.) Each character starts with a number of spell points equal to their creativity score. Characters can use spell points to create magical effects, described in [Magic](#magic) below.

## Playing the Game

You have your character in front of you and your friends at your side. It's time to get into it!

### Ability and Contest Checks

During a game, your character might face challenges that can't be resolved through role-play alone. How will you know if your character is strong enough to break down a door? Or perceptive enough to spot the pickpocket that just robbed you? In these situations you'll make either an **ability check** or a **contest check** with the relevant statistic to see if you succeed.

To make an **ability check**, the game master first sets a threshold for the check. Then, you roll a 12-sided die and add your relevant statistic to the result. Compare that result to the threshold - if it's equal or higher, you succeed! You can also apply your skills to an ability check. If one of your skills is relevant to the check, you can roll the die twice and choose which result you want to use (usually the higher one). If more than one of your skills is relevant, you can still only roll the die twice. Sorry, no overlapping skills!

A **contest check** is like an ability check, except that instead of making the check against a predetermined threshold, the result is compared to the result of another character's ability check. The character with the higher result wins the contest and the other loses it. In the case of a tie, the winner should be chosen randomly (such as by flipping a coin).

### Combat

The bandits have laid a trap, and you've fallen right into it - you're surrounded! How will you get out of this one? If you can't persuade them to let you go, you might have to engage in combat.

The primary activity in combat is role-playing. The player characters should describe what their characters are doing, including where they move, what spells they cast, and what special attacks they try to execute. Similarly, the game master should narrate the actions of the characters' enemies.

Once the characters have described their actions, the game master will mediate one or more ability and contest checks between the combatants. Each check may have different results, depending on the success of the ability check or winner of the contest, what its context was, and any environmental effects that applied to it.

For example, say that a party of four characters - Izzirix, Pyrite, Grigg, and Grizgith - is encountering Paparnad, a villainous wizard, at the climax of their adventure. Paparnad is attempting to flee with a stolen artifact and has chosen a path that takes him along a narrow ledge over a sheer drop. When the characters catch up to him, they are already far out on the ledge. This complicated scenario might go as follows:

> Game master: You see the evil wizard Paparnad carefully making his way along the ledge ahead of you. He seems to be interested only in escaping!

> Izzirix: I want to chase after him.

> Grigg: I'll do the same. We've got to stop him!

> Grizgith: I have a bad feeling about going out onto the ledge, so I'll try to shoot an arrow at him from here.

> Pyrite: I'm going to cast a spell to cause stone hands to grab him and stop him from falling. We can't let the artifact fall down the cliff!

> Game master: Alright. Izzirix and Grigg, make dexterity rolls. You're competing with Paparnad to see how fast you can run along the ledge without falling. He rolled 6, so he's not very fast right now. Grizgith, you'll also make a dexterity roll against Paparnad to see if you can hit him. For this one he rolled 11. Finally, Pyrite, you'll need to make a creativity roll to see if you can bend the natural stone to your will. The threshold is 10.

All four players make their rolls at the same time. Izzirix rolls 8, Grigg rolls 5, Grizgith rolls 11, and Pyrite rolls 12. Izzirix beat Paparnad's roll, so she'll be able to catch up with him. Grigg rolled lower, so he'll be slower than both Izzirix and Paparnad. Grizgith tied Paparnad's roll to dodge the arrow, so the game master flips a coin to determine the winner of the contest - and Grizgith wins! The arrow hits Paparnad and he loses one hit point. Finally, Pyrite passes the threshold for her spell and stone hands reach out of the wall to grab Paparnad. Now he's trapped in place, so Grigg will be able to catch up after all.

> Izzirix: Awesome! I'm the fastest on the ledge, so I'm going to run up to Paparnad and try to take the artifact from him.

> Grigg: I'm just behind you, so I'll just hold you steady to make sure you don't fall.

> Grizgith: If Paparnad isn't ready to give in, I'll shoot another arrow to let him know we mean business.

> Pyrite: I'll wait to hear what Paparnad does before choosing my move.

> Game master: Good idea, because Paparnad is casting a spell. He's going to conjure a cloud of poisonous gas - right around the heads of Izzirix and Grigg!

> Pyrite: Ooh, then I know what I'll do. I'll use my last spell points to summon a wind that will disperse the cloud.

> Game master: Nicely done. The cloud of poisonous gas disperses immediately after Paparnad conjures it, so it doesn't hurt anyone at all. Then Izzirix, you'll need to make a strength roll against Paparnad to wrench the artifact from his grasp. He rolled an 8 this time. Grizgith, you'll make the same dexterity roll as last time to hit Paparnad with an arrow. He rolled really low - only a 4. Grigg, you don't need to roll this time.

Izzirix rolls a 9, beating Paparnad's roll. Grizgith rolls an 8, also beating Paparnad's roll, hitting him with another arrow.

> Game master: Grizgith, your arrow strikes Paparnad in the shoulder and he loses another hit point. Meanwhile, the stone hands from Pyrite's spell hold him in place as Izzirix wrestles with Paparnad for the artifact - and succeeds! Izzirix, you now hold the artifact in your hands.

Now, unless Paparnad has another nefarious trick up his sleeve, the fight is probably over and normal role-playing can resume. The player characters have stopped Paparnad in his tracks and retrieved the artifact. High fives all around!
