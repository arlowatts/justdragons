Seers can divine the future and plan accordingly, granting confidence to themselves or to their clients. A good seer is an invaluable asset in any discipline, from farming to sailing to ruling. They command respect from every rank, and keep their methods secret from outsiders.

## Abilities

### Truth Sense

For every 1 minute you spend talking to someone, you can determine whether someone is lying about a specific factual statement.

### Future Sight

Once per day, you can peer into the future and see a potential outcome of a specific course of action or sequence of events. The farther you look into the future, the less certain your vision will be. While you are looking into the future, you can't see or hear anything happening in the present.
