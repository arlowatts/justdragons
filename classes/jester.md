Jesters are experts of mockery, masters of mimicry, and second to none in comedy. Though their own reputation is such that they could never hold a position of leadership, they are invaluable on the political stage for their humbling skill in humiliation.

## Abilities

### Perfect Mimicry

You can perfectly mimic anyone's voice, as long as you have heard them speak for at least 1 minute.

### Mime Hypnosis

Once per day, you can hypnotize someone who is looking at you. While hypnotized, they mimic your actions to the best of their ability. If they would do something dangerous, if you speak or break eye contact, or after a minute passes, the hypnosis ends. They don't remember the time they spent hypnotized.
