  content:
    'Once per day, you can intimidate someone you are talking to. While intimidated, they are afraid of you and lose the ability to speak except to answer questions you ask them directly. They are not compelled to tell the truth. You can also command them where to go, such as to come closer to you or to sit down. If someone else addresses them directly, if they lose sight of you, or after a minute passes, the intimidation ends.'

Warriors train for years to master the martial arts, and they study the politics of war for just as long. Their line of work demands self-confidence and self-control, and warriors who lack such qualities often resort to crime and banditry to make a living.
